This package allows you to attach a key-value store to a model, e.g. to store preferences of
an user or a customer. The package supports arbitrary datatypes, defaults and model hierarchies,
i.e. you can define a different model instance as your instance's parent and the values of the
parent instance will be used as default values for the child instances.

This approach has been in use in `pretix`_ for quite a while, so it has been tested in
production.

Tested with Python 3.8-3.10 and Django 3.2-4.0.
